#+Title: PAPA Control Manual

* Introduction

This document servers as the main user manual for the control software
for the PAPA detector.  The program was written for python 2.6 and
requires the following libraries:

 - [[http://ni.com][DaqMx]]: A library from National Instruments for speaking interfacing
   with their digital IO cards.  Specifically, we use the nicaiu.dll
   file.
 - BmmServer4: A server program written by the SNS which records the
   spectrum on the neutron beam monitor.  This program is part of the
   SNS dcom system.
 - [[http://numpy.org][NumPy]]: A numerical library for python
 - [[http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/][PySerial]]: A python library for communicating over a computer's
   serial port.
 - Current Listener: A LabView program on the motor server which
   controls the current in the power supplies.  An energetic grad
   student should replace this with more python code in order to
   condense us down to a single language.  Also, LabView VIs _hate_
   text based source control.

* Basic Usage
	     
The recommended way to run the control system is to load up Control.py
into an interactive python prompt.  This can be done by using the -i
command line switch on python.  To simplify this process, a batch file
is kept on the desktop of the control computer which will do this
loading automatically.

Control.py defines a control object in the variable *c*.  This object
is the main interface for controlling the instrument.  At any time,
the command *help(c)* will display the documentation on all of the
control object's member functions.

To close the program, use the *exit()* function.  This will kill all
of the detector processes and handle the shutdown of the resources
acquired by the program.  Do not use the *quit()* command, as it will
not kill the detector and instrument threads.

* Power supplies
		
The instrument uses two different types of Kepco power supplies.
There are eight 20A/20V power supplies used to power the triangle
coils and four 10A/20V power supplies for the remaining solenoids.
The triangle supplies are controlled via the *triangle* member
function, which takes the power supply's number and the desired
current.  For instance, *c.triangle(3,-7)* sets the current in the
third power supply to -7A.  The 10A power supplies are named
*flipper*, *guides*, *phase*, and *sample* and can be adjust by the
eponymous member function.  For instance, *c.triangle(4)* sets the
current in the triangle power supply to 4A.

* Making a polarization measurement
				   
  The *flippingrun* member function starts data collection on a
  polarization measurement.  The function takes one argument: a tuple
  that controls the amount of time spent in the spin up and spin down
  states.  For instance, *c.flippingrun((1,3))* takes 120 seconds of
  data in the first spin state, then 360 seconds of data in the second
  before repeating the process.  The spin state is chosen by flipping
  the current in the guides power supply.  As there is some overhead
  involved in flipping the currents, longer runs may benefit from
  having longer times given (e.g. *c.flippingrun((10,30))* would spend
  1200 seconds in the first spin state and 3600 in the second).  For
  the best statistics, the times should be chosen so that the ratio
  between the time spent in the low count state to the time in the
  high count state is equal to the square root of the flipping ration.

  To end a measurement, use the *stop* member function.

* Detector Control
		  
  It may become necessay to change the settings on the PAPA detector.
  The current settings can be queried with the *query* member
  function, while the values can be set through the
  *detectorParameter* member function.  Global variables *q* and *d*
  reference *query* and *detectorParameter*, respectively.

* Design

  
	
* Basic Usage

The recommended way to run the control system is to load up Control.py
into an interactive python prompt.  This can be done by using the -i
command line switch on python.  To simplify this process, a batch file
is kept on the desktop of the control computer which will do this
loading automatically.

Control.py defines a control object in the variable *c*.  This object
is the main interface for controlling the instrument.  At any time,
the command *help(c)* will display the documentation on all of the
control object's member functions.

To close the program, use the *exit()* function.  This will kill all
of the detector processes and handle the shutdown of the resources
acquired by the program.  Do not use the *quit()* command, as it will
not kill the detector and instrument threads.

* Power supplies

The instrument uses two different types of Kepco power supplies.
There are eight 20A/20V power supplies used to power the triangle
coils and four 10A/20V power supplies for the remaining solenoids.
The triangle supplies are controlled via the *triangle* member
function, which takes the power supply's number and the desired
current.  For instance, *c.triangle(3,-7)* sets the current in the
third power supply to -7A.  The 10A power supplies are named
*flipper*, *guides*, *phase*, and *sample* and can be adjust by the
eponymous member function.  For instance, *c.triangle(4)* sets the
current in the triangle power supply to 4A.

* Making a polarization measurement

  The *flippingrun* member function starts data collection on a
  polarization measurement.  The function takes one argument: a tuple
  that controls the amount of time spent in the spin up and spin down
  states.  For instance, *c.flippingrun((1,3))* takes 120 seconds of
  data in the first spin state, then 360 seconds of data in the second
  before repeating the process.  The spin state is chosen by flipping
  the current in the guides power supply.  As there is some overhead
  involved in flipping the currents, longer runs may benefit from
  having longer times given (e.g. *c.flippingrun((10,30))* would spend
  1200 seconds in the first spin state and 3600 in the second).  For
  the best statistics, the times should be chosen so that the ratio
  between the time spent in the low count state to the time in the
  high count state is equal to the square root of the flipping ration.

  To end a measurement, use the *stop* member function.

* Detector Control

  It may become necessay to change the settings on the PAPA detector.
  The current settings can be queried with the *query* member
  function, while the values can be set through the
  *detectorParameter* member function.  Global variables *q* and *d*
  reference *query* and *detectorParameter*, respectively.

  Here's a list of the parameters that can be read and adjusted:
